### Description

This is an unofficial client app to list some information from the amazing website [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/), the motivation to this became
when I discovered the amazing API that they have for free, so I decided to build something to use their API. The main features for the app is already developed, but some of
the features that I have in mind will be developed soon.
